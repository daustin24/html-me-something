            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>Hello I'm Darius, I don't wanna go on about my enjoyement of long walks on beaches. I'm simply here to give a simple introduction.
             I'm from Howardville, a small town in the bootheel of Missouri with a poplulation of a few hundred people. The town is so small in fact 
             that it only really consists of of 13 streets, you could probably get from one end to the other in under a half hour walking.</p>
            <p>I am a creative, as goofy as it sounds. I like making stuff music, art, ... that's about it. I say "create" but in all honesty I haven't really
             finished all too much as of late but I digress.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div id = "currentProjects"> 
            <h2>Current Projects</h2>
            <p><strong>I</strong>'m not typically one to stick to one thing. I usually find myself juggling several things at once instead of taking the time to finish one. These following projects all had good enough bones to invigorate me to work on them more than just an initial sketch. Most often don't make it this far due to me just falling out of interest, or upon further inspection they weren't as solid ideas as I previously percived them to be. </p>

                <p>SighyFy is a satirical comedic comic follwing the adventures of "Lance" and his alien companion "Stato"
                 </p>
    
                <li><h3>Kings of Lords of Kings</h3></li>
                 <p>Kings of Lords of Kings is cartoon series in which I take historical moments and turn them into early disney-esque reninactments. For this projects I only have a rough animatic of the War of 1812 </p>
    
                <li><h3>The Dangers of Coding</h3></li>
            <p>The Dangers of Coding is the most recent project I've started, DoC really just follows my journey through LaunchCode and how I cope with these seemingly incermountable problems week by week. Like most of my projects it does have an art element to it. At this moment I have only 3 stills made of my experiences so far with the class.</p>
